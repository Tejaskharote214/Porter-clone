This a E-commers website where an user can be able to book a service from packers and movers. Mostly useful for the people who are shifting form one place to another place.
In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of Porter.in Website. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned till now in Unit-3 in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end with same looking &amp; features. And now in Unit-4 we are working on the backend part of our project and the flow from which our frontend will connect and collect data to backend.
